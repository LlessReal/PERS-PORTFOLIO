    <h3>The internet should be used less as a reputable source</h3>
    <p>
    The web is impairing the way that we judge things around the world. This is proven
    from the article "The semiotics of the anti-COVID-19 mask" where it says, 
    “An established cultural tradition has already turned such functional objects 
    into semiotic and communicative devices, which can be even dissociated from their practical 
    protective function and displayed and/or received as purely aesthetic devices.” (LEONE). 
    This article mainly talks about how the importance of the anti-COVID-19 mask and its protection
    against a deadly virus was eradicated because of how people (moreso the internet) found it to be 
    a great alternative for fashion, which is wrong.
    The web also ruins society's thinking on certain media because of how online users tend 
    to attempt to read the minds of certain popular figures within drama. A good example would be
    during the Kris Tyson and MrBeast drama where MrBeast would be accused of protecting his friend
    and co-host, Kris Tyson, who had several serious allegations against him regarding pedophilia. These
    potentially false accusations started from joke posts by MrBeast such as one claiming him to be hiring
    1,000 lawyers to protect Kris from the allegations.
