    <h3>The internet should be used less as a reputable source</h3>
    <p>The web is impairing the way that we judge things around the world. 
        An example of how this is so comes from the article "The semiotics of the anti-COVID-19 mask" 
        where it says, “An established cultural tradition has already turned such functional objects 
        into semiotic and communicative devices, which can be even dissociated from their practical 
        protective function and displayed and/or received as purely aesthetic devices.” (LEONE). 
        This article mainly talks about the semiotics of the anti-COVID-19 mask. 
        In this particular section of the article, it is stating that things used for certain purposes 
        can be altered to be for fashion.</p>
