    <p>The web is impairing our judgment skills because there are social media platform users who are. According to the article, The semiotics of the anti-COVID-19 mask, “An established cultural tradition has already turned such functional objects into semiotic and communicative devices, which can be even dissociated from their practical protective function and displayed and/or received as purely aesthetic devices.” (LEONE). This article mainly talks about the semiotics of the anti-COVID-19 mask. In this particular section of the article, it is stating that things used for certain purposes can be altered to be for fashion. If markets were to investigate more into how certain objects like these turn into aesthetics, think of the profit they could make. Markets could use these in order to develop new products. Traffic lights made a large change in the way that people drive around, so imagine the amount of change that can happen if markets manipulate this practice. </p>
