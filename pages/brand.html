        <h3>People should use public brands for professionality</h3>
        <p>
        People should use public brands more often to present themselves professionally. 
        They could do this by using Linkedin or some shit. Marketing managers regularly 
        support the notion that the perceived authenticity of a brand is a foundation of 
        success because it is believed that consumers have a desire for and are drawn toward 
        brands perceived to be authentic" (Rixom and Rixom). What the article is basically saying is that
        employers from companies (specifically marketing in this case), tend to look for people
        with a valid professional identity. This resonates deep within me because marketing is
        a very popular industry, and it shows how popular platforms like LinkedIn are. Even if you
        were to not have a brand that's specifically meant to represent you professionally, you can still 
        set a certain identity where you're shown to be a great and acceptable person similar to MrBeast, 
        who is a content creator who gives money away to those in need like it's a monday. This brought
        him many opportunities professionally, such as allowing him to have his own restaurant and chocolate
        bars. In other words, having a public brand in general that is preferred from employers is a general
        need.
