        <h3>People should use public brands for professionality</h3>
        <p>People should use public brands more often to present themselves professionally. 
            They could do this by using linkedin or some shit. Marketing managers regularly 
            support the notion that the perceived authenticity of a brand is a foundation of 
            success because it is believed that consumers have a desire for and are drawn toward 
            brands perceived to be authentic" (Rixom and Rixom). What the article is basically saying is that
            employers from companies (specifically marketing in this case), tend to look for people
        with a valid professional identity. This resonates deep within me because marketing is
    a very popular industry, and it shows how popular platforms like LinkedIn are. People should utilize
    these types of platforms to represent themselves better to employers. </p>
